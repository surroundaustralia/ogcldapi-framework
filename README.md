# OGC API LD core
This is an OGC API and Linked Data-conforming API.

Expected use is for this code to draw from a data source that full characterises the API instance, i.e. no special configuration of this API should be made, other than the data source (an RDFlib Graph *store*), for content. HTML styling, if desired, will need to be applied to this API too, within the `view/` module (folder).
